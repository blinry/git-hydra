git-hydra
=========

This tool visualizes the internal structure of a Git repository in real-time.

Dependencies
------------

- libgit2 (http://libgit2.github.com/) >=0.16
- SFML (http://sfml-dev.org/) in a recent, 2.0-ish version

It's highly recommended to have a recent version of Git, too! :-)

Installation
------------

Just type "make". Add this directory to your PATH.

Usage
-----

When you're inside a git repository, run "git-hydra".

- Move nodes by dragging with the right mouse button.
- Select nodes with the left mouse button. This unfolds commits!
- Press "i" to link the index entries with the corresponding blobs.
- Press "o" to show all objects, not just the reachable ones.
- Press "r" to show all refs, not just those below HEAD.

You can scroll the commit history and the index with your mouse wheel.
