git-hydra
=========

This tool visualizes the internal structure of a Git repository in real-time.

Dependencies
------------

You'll need the libraries to compile SFML:

- pthread
- opengl
- xlib
- xrandr
- freetype
- glew
- jpeg
- sndfile
- openal

SFML and libgit2 itself are included in this project (for now). If you cloned
this from the Git repository, issue

    git submodule init && git submodule update

to set them up. If you took this from the PADI-SVN, they are already in place.
It's highly recommended to have a recent version of Git, too! :-)

Installation
------------

Just type "make". Add this directory to your PATH.

Usage
-----

When you're inside a git repository, run "git-hydra".

- Move nodes by dragging with the right mouse button.
- Select nodes with the left mouse button. This unfolds commits!
- Press "i" to link the index entries with the corresponding blobs.
- Press "a" to show all objects, not just the reachable ones.

You can scroll the commit history and the index with your mouse wheel.
